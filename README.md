# Libq

Libq is an experimenta "standard" library for the experimebntal Q programming language: https://git.urbach.dev/cli/q.
Libq is inspired mostly by libc and attempts to be portable, but focuses on Linux first.
To test it you need to install the Q compiler first.

This library reuses the lib folder as provided by the q compiler as the basis of the library.

The editor contains editor support files.
The syntax highlighting file for micro is for versions up to 2.0.14.
